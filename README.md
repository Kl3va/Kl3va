<h1>Hey! :v:</h1>

<h2>Welcome to my profile.</h2>

I'm a Frontend developer who's biased towards everything JavaScript n it's ecosystem :smile:

When I'm not codingðŸ’», I'd probably be on qoura/youtube/twitter, listening to music ðŸŽµ, battling with my fpl set up, or even watching a tv show ðŸŽ¥. (Chances are, I'd be diving into an article about tech or something something philosophy, but that's not all, Trust me! :smirk: )... Currently learning nodeJS.

You can always reach out by sending a mail across to *ikwunzekelvin@gmail.com* 

Gracias! ðŸ™Œ
